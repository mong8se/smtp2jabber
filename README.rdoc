= smtp2jabber

== What

An eventmachine-based simple smtp to jabber gateway.

== Why

I built this for monit to IM me alerts.

== How

* Put it somewhere on your path, executable
* Set the PID file to go to somewhere readable
* Setup upstart or an init script to run it as an unprivileged user
* Configure monit to use it as the global smtp server, with the username/password being the username/password for the jabber account you want the messages to come FROM.
* Configure monit to send the alerts to the jabber account you wan the messages to go TO
* Configure monit to run the upstart job/init script to run this thang

Better docs/example config will come later.

   NOTE: the craziest bit is that whatever username/password
   are sent as authentication to the smtp server, are what is
   used to log into jabber. So there isn't any authentication
   on the smtp server--only have it listen on localhost!

   This may be too crazy!
